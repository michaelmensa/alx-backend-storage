# MySQL Advanced Learning Objectives

## General

### How to Create Tables with Constraints

Creating tables with constraints is a crucial aspect of database design and management. In MySQL, you will learn to use the `CREATE TABLE` statement with various constraints such as:

- **Primary Key Constraint:** Creating a primary key to uniquely identify each record in the table.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE example (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
  );
  ```

- **Foreign Key Constraint:** Establishing relationships between tables by defining foreign keys.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
  );
  ```

- **Check Con statements that can be executed with a single call. They enhance code modularity and reusability.

- **Stored Procedure Example:**
  ```sql
  DELIMITER //

  CREATE PROCEDURE sp_example(IN param1 INT, OUT result INT)
  BEGIN
    -- Procedure logic here
    SET result = param1 * 2;
  END //

  DELIMITER ;
  ```

- **Function Example:**
  ```sql
  DELIMITER //

  CREATE FUNCTION fn_example(param1 INT) RETURNS INT
  BEGIN
    -- Function logic here
    RETURN param1 * 2;
  END //

  DELIMITER ;
  ```

## Views

### What is and How to Implement Views in MySQL

Views are virtual tables generated from the result of a SELECT query. They simplify complex queries and encapsulate logic.

- **Creating a View:**
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW view_name AS
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **Updating a View:**
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
  SELECT new_columns
  FROM new_conditions;
  ```

## Triggers

### What is and How to Implement Triggers in MySQL

Triggers are actions that are automatically performed in response to certain events on a particular table.

- **Creating a Trigger:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
  BEFORE INSERT ON table_name
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
    -- Trigger logic here
  END;
  ```

- **Trigger Events:**
  - `BEFORE INSERT`
  - `AFTER INSERT`
  - `BEFORE UPDATE`
  - `AFTER UPDATE`
  - `BEFORE DELETE`
  - `AFTER DELETE`
  ```

These learning objectives will equip you with advanced skills in MySQL database management, enabling you to create well-structured databases, optimize queries, and implement advanced features like stored procedures, views, and triggers.
```straint:** Defining conditions that must be met for data to be inserted or updated.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
  );
  ```

### How to Optimize Queries by Adding Indexes

Optimizing queries is essential for improving database performance. You will learn to add indexes to columns, speeding up data retrieval operations. Examples include:

- **Single-Column Index:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
  ```

- **Composite Index:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
  ```

- **Unique Index:**
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
  ```
