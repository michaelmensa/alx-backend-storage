# NoSQL - MongoDB Project

## Learning Objectives

### General

- **What NoSQL means**
  
  NoSQL, or "Not Only SQL," refers to a type of database management system (DBMS) that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in ways other than the tabular relations used in relational databases (like SQL databases).

- **What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL**
  
  SQL databases are relational databases, usinand other issues.

- **What is document storage**
  
  Document storage is a data storage paradigm used by NoSQL databases where data is stored in semi-structured documents. These documents can be in various formats such as JSON, BSON, XML, etc., and they g structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational and can handle a variety of data models, offering flexibility in schema design.

- **What is ACID**
  
  ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. These properties ensure that database transactions are processed reliably, even in the face of errors, power failures, can contain key-value pairs, arrays, or other nested structures.

- **What are NoSQL types**
  
  NoSQL databases can be categorized into various types:
  
  - **Document Store:** Stores data in semi-structured documents (e.g., MongoDB).
  - **Key-Value Store:** Stores data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis).
  - **Column-family Store:** Stores data in columns rather than rows (e.g., Apache Cassandra).
  - **Graph Database:** Stores data in graph structures (e.g., Neo4j).

- **What are the benefits of a NoSQL database**
  
  Benefits of NoSQL databases include:
  
  - **Flexible Schema:** NoSQL databases allow dynamic and flexible schema, accommodating diverse data types.
  - **Scalability:** NoSQL databases can easily scale horizontally, handling large amounts of data and traffic.
  - **Performance:** NoSQL databases are often optimized for specific use cases, providing better performance for certain types of queries.
  - **Availability:** NoSQL databases are designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant.

- **How to query information from a NoSQL database**
  
  Querying in NoSQL databases often involves using specific query languages or methods depending on the database type. For MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database, querying involves using MongoDB Query Language (MQL), which is similar to JSON.

- **How to insert/update/delete information from a NoSQL database**
  
  Inserting, updating, and deleting information in a NoSQL database can be achieved using database-specific commands or APIs. In MongoDB, for instance, you would use commands like `insert`, `update`, and `delete` to perform these operations.

- **How to use MongoDB**
  
  Using MongoDB involves:
  
  - **Installation:** Install MongoDB on your system.
  - **Connection:** Connect to the MongoDB server using a client or a programming language driver.
  - **Database and Collection Creation:** Create a database and collections to organize your data.
  - **Data Manipulation:** Use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to interact with data.
  - **Indexing:** Optimize query performance by creating indexes.
  - **Aggregation:** Use MongoDB's aggregation framework for complex queries.
  
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain these concepts and perform basic operations in MongoDB without relying on external assistance.
